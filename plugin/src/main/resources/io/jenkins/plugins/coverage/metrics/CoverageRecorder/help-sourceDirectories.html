    Since the plugin also reads the affected source code files it needs to copy these files from the agent to the
    controller. If these files are not part of the workspace (or checked out into a sub folder of the workspace) they
    are not automatically found. So you can add one or more source code directories where the plugin tries to find
    these files. Note, that due to security restrictions additional paths outside the workspace need to be registered
    in Jenkins system configuration before they can be used here.
