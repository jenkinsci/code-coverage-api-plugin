        Select additional folders that contain the source code files of the job.
        Since the plugin also reads the affected source code files it needs to copy these files from the agent to the
        controller. If these files are not part of the workspace (or checked out into a sub folder of the workspace)
        they
        are not automatically found. So you can add one or more source code directories where the plugin tries to find
        these files. You can add relative paths in the workspace root, absolute paths, or expressions using the glob or
        regexp syntaxes that are supported by the Java
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)"
           target="_blank"
           rel="noopener noreferrer">FileSystem#getPathMatcher</a> implementation.
        Note, that due to security restrictions additional paths outside the workspace need to be registered
        in Jenkins system configuration before they can be used here.

    Examples for the syntax and pattern property:
    <dl>
        <dt>submodule/src/main/java</dt>
        <dd>
            Relative path <code>submodule/src/main/java</code> in the Jenkins workspace.
        </dd>
        <dt>glob:**/src/main/java</dt>
        <dd>
            A glob that expands to all folders in the Jenkins workspace that contain the sub-path
            <code>src/main/java</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>regex:sources.*/src/main/java</dt>
        <dd>
            A regular expression that matches all folders in the Jenkins workspace that start with <code>sources</code>
            and end with the text <code>src/main/java</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>C:\work\sources</dt>
        <dd>
            Absolute path on the <b>agent</b> that builds the sources. This folder must also be approved by a Jenkins
            administrator in Jenkins global configuration.
        </dd>
    </dl>
